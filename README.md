# horiseon-coderefactor
Week 1 Homework

In this task we were asked to improve the sematic elements of Horiseons website. I have added descriptive elements to the HTML, remove repeating elements in the CSS and provide appropriate comments for the CSS elements. 

I have learned how to properly set up a GitHub repository so that it will correctly deploy a website.
